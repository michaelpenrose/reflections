When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    To share work with others to contribute
    To share work with others to view
    To back up work
    To enable working from different computers

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    There might be conflicting changes I am working on locally that aren't complete
    Someone else might make an update that I don't want e.g. because it isn't ready

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    A branch exists locally to work on a bug fix or new feature without effecting the master branch
    A clone copies a repository, it can be done locally or on github. It doesn't give credit to the original source by default.
    A fork is done on GitHub, it does give credit to the original source. The fork can then be cloned to the local machine.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
